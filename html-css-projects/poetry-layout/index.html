    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <div class="author">By Robert Frost</div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <span>Some say the world will end in fire,</span>
        <span>Some say in ice.</span>
        <span>From what I've tasted of desire</span>
        <span>I hold with those who favor fire.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>But if it had to perish twice,</span>
        <span>I think I know enough of hate</span>
        <span>To say that for destruction ice</span>
        <span>Is also great</span>
        <span>And would suffice.</span>
      </p>
